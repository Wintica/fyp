            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-2">
              Mrs. Amelia Morgan was the epitome of independence and organization. As a respected teacher at Oakwood Elementary for thirty-five years, she prided herself on meticulous planning, professional appearance, and never needing help from anyone. After raising Sarah alone following her husband's death, Amelia's mantra became "I can handle it myself." She took great care in her appearance; crisp blouses, polished shoes, weekly salon appointments, believing that presentation reflected self-respect. However, subtle changes began emerging: standing confused in her closet, changing clothes multiple times, and becoming defensive when Sarah offered gentle suggestions about her appearance. The woman who once taught patience to children was losing her own, interpreting any assistance as attacks on the independence she'd spent a lifetime building.

            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-2">
            Two years after her Alzheimer's diagnosis, Amelia's world collapsed. Forced into early retirement from teaching, she struggled as Sarah moved back home to become her caregiver. Their roles reversed painfully. Sarah now manages medications, labeling cabinets, and redirecting her mother's confusion. Amelia's legendary organization dissolved into chaos as she searched frantically for old grade books and prepared meals for imaginary visitors. Her nurturing nature became misdirected, worrying about non-existent problems while her ability to manage basic tasks disappeared. The independent woman who once balanced checkbooks to the penny now stared at bills with blank confusion.

            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-2">
              At seventy-two, Amelia lives in moments rather than memories. Her teacher instincts still emerge such as correcting posture, straightening frames, humming the alphabet while folding laundry. Though the disease stole her timeline, her essential kindness remains: gentle touches, genuine gratitude, and innate courtesy even toward Sarah when she doesn't recognize her as her daughter. Sarah has learned to find beauty in their new normal through photo albums, baking sessions guided by muscle memory, and quiet moments when Amelia's eyes clear with recognition. Love now fills the spaces where memory once lived, with Amelia still teaching lessons about grace and unconditional love despite her transformed state.
